            <p>I promise that, except for anything that you gave me to incorporate into the design(s):
              <br>(a) My work will be original and will not be copied in whole or in part from any other work;
              <br>(b) I own the rights that I am giving you under this Agreement, or I have secured such rights to any third-party content incorporated into my final design(s); and
              <br>(c) My work does not violate the patent, copyright, trade secret or other property right of any person, firm or entity.
            </p>
            <p>I promise that this Agreement does not conflict with any other contract, agreement or understanding to which I am a party. Finally, I promise that I’ll hold and maintain in strict confidence any confidential information that you provide me (such as proprietary technical or business information), and I will not disclose such information to any third party except as may be required by a court or governmental authority.</p>
            <p>All design work and the draft showcase will be published on a test server that could be used to view the design on a browser or for review purpose. Before the final payment settlement is done, I in no condition will share any editable source file or any artwork that contains my work and labor.</p>
            <p>Once the payment is settled and both party agree, every asset, editable source file, document, artwork, programmed files will be shared through a 3rd Party Sharing Service like Dropbox or Google Drive or any storage device.</p>

          <div class="info">
            <p>A 50% deposit of the total fee payable under our proposal is due immediately upon you instructing me to proceed with the website design and development work. The remaining 50% shall become due when the work is completed to your reasonable satisfaction but subject to the terms of the “approval of work” and “rejected work” clauses. I reserve the right not to commence any work until the deposit has been paid in full. The 50% deposit is only refundable if I have not fulfilled my obligations to deliver the work required under the agreement. The deposit is not refundable if the design/development work has been started and you terminate the contract through no fault of mine.</p>

          <div class="info">
            <p>You must supply all materials and information required by me to complete the work in accordance with any agreed specification. Such materials may include, but are not limited to, photographs, written copy, logos and other printed material. Where there is any delay in supplying these materials to me which leads to a delay in the completion of work, I have the right to extend any previously agreed deadlines by a reasonable amount. Where you fail to supply materials, and that prevents the progress of the work, I have the right to invoice you for any part or parts of the work already completed.</p>

          <div class="subtitle">Project Variations</div>
          <div class="info">
            <p>I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to make revisions to the design up to 6 times. However, in case of requirement for additional design changes more than 5 times or as per mutual agreement, that may arise due to change or modification in original design specification, I may charge an extra fee . The website development phase is flexible and allows certain variations to the original specification. However any major deviation from the specification will attract an extra charge.</p>

It is required that a single point of contact be appointed from your side and be made available on a daily basis in order to expedite the feedback process.</p>

Once approved, or deemed approved, work cannot subsequently be rejected and the contract will be deemed to have been completed and the 50% balance of the project price will become due.</p>
